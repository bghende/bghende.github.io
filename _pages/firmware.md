The interface of hardware and software technologies is at the core of my interest and expertise in computing systems. Recent advances in system-on-a-chip architectures <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html" target="_blank">Xilinx Zynq</a> have greatly expanded what is achievable with programmable systems. These architectures integrate traditional microprocessors with high-performance programmable FPGA fabric. Effectively exploiting these architectures requires knowledge of both programmable hardware and software.  

Listed below is a selection of the embedded architectures and tools that I have experience using to develop embedded systems. 



## Architectures

* Xilinx FPGA (Virtex 5, Spartan 3)
* Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC (MicroZed)
* Embedded x86 (Linux)
* Xilinx MicroBlaze
* National Instruments (PXI, FlexRIO, CompactRIO)
* PIC32 MCU
* NetBurner (68K)
* ARM

## Tools and Compilers

* Xilinx Vivado 
* Xilinx ISE/EDK/SDK
* Xilinx ISim RTL Simulator
* LabVIEW FPGA
* LabVIEW Real-Time
* Microchip MPLAB
* gcc/gdb
