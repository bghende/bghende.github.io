Development of a complete embedded system solution requires knowledge of electronic systems in order to interface to the outside world. In my designs, I utilize COTS modules and daughter cards whenever possible to speed development and reduce risk. I use CadSoft EAGLE for schematic capture and PCB layout. I also have a working knowledge of a modern electronics laboratory and am well versed in electronics troubleshooting techniques and tools. 

## Design Skills
