## Background
I have significant experience in all aspects of software development including design, architecture, implementation, and maintenance. 

## Development Philosophy

* Use configuration management and issue tracking tools from day one.
* Deliver a minimal prototype as early as possible in the development cycle.
* Simpler is always better. Don't write code for a theoretical future requirement that may never be needed.

## Programming Languages / Environments

| Language                  | Environment                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| C/C++                     | QT / Visual Studio / Eclipse / Embedded / gcc / gdb |
| C# / .NET                 | Visual Studio / Windows Forms                       |
| Python                    | NumPy / SciPy / IPython / Django                    |
| Matlab                    | Matlab / Octave                                     |
