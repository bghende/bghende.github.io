## Background
I have significant experience in all aspects of software development including design, architecture, implementation, and maintenance. 

## Development Philosophy
* Use configuration management and issue tracking tools from day one.
* Deliver a minimal prototype as early as possible in the development cycle.
* Simpler is always better. Don't write code for a theoretical future requirement that may never be needed.

## Programming Languages / Environments

| Language                  | Environments / Platforms                      |

| LabVIEW                   | LabVIEW / LabVIEW RT / LabVIEW FPGA           |
| Matlab                    | Mathworks MATLAB / GNU Octave                 |
| Swift                     | Xcode                                         |
